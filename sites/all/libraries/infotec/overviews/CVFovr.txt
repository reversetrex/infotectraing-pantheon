Three e-learning modules teach the basic concepts and terminology to transition from traditional analog telephony to Voice Over IP. They review basic telephony concepts, highlight the special considerations and expectations of services when voice calls are put on a digital network, and explore the features and benefits from Voice Over IP and Cisco voice applications. These three modules were removed from the CVOICE course and developed as self-study, web-based training of about 6 hours duration. CVF is a pre-requisite to CVOICE v5, and later.
