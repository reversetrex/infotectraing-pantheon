The Certified Authorization Professional (CAP) course is designed for the information security practitioner who champions system security commensurate with an organization's mission and risk tolerance, while meeting legal and regulatory requirements. The CAP certification course conceptually mirrors the NIST system authorization process in compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Appendix III. This 3-day program is comprised of a total of seven domains. The modular format is designed to organize and chunk information in order to assist with learning retention as participants are guided through the CAP course materials.
