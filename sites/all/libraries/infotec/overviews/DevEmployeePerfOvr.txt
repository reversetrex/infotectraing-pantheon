This ILT Series course teaches students to develop the skills needed to address a difficult person according to their specific behavior. Students will have the opportunity to meet with several Marketing Department team members to address their difficult personalities, follow the guidelines for managing difficult people to decrease the department's turnover rate and meet the release date for a new product. Students will also learn how to give constructive feedback-both praise and criticism-to subordinates or peers, and use strategies for effective conflict resolution. Course activities also cover addressing conflict between managers, between employees, and among team members. The manual is designed for quick scanning in the classroom and filled with interactive exercises that help ensure student success.
