This course is designed to help Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 students who need 
to sharpen their skills and serves as a resource that teachers can employ 
to help struggling students stay up to speed. Professor Terry Caliste 
helps students understand and compare the properties of classes of 
functions, including exponential, polynomial, rational, logarithmic, and 
periodic functions. He begins with simplifying polynomials and then moves 
on to adding and subtracting polynomials.
