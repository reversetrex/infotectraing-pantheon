In the previous Excel courses, you used Excel to simplify business tasks, including the creation of spreadsheets, graphs, charts, and formulas that were difficult to create and nearly impossible to maintain using pencil and paper. You now want to simplify your work in the Excel environment by automating many of the repetitive tasks that are part of the spreadsheet development. In this course, you will apply the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language to simplify many of the tasks that you can perform using various tools and functions in Excel 2007.
