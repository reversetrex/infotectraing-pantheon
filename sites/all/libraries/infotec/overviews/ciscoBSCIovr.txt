The BSCI 2.1 course is recommended training for individuals seeking certification as a Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP). BSCI 2.1 instructs network administrators of medium-to-large network sites on the use of advanced IP addressing and routing in implementing scalability for Cisco routers connected to LANs and WANs. The goal is to train network administrators to grow a dramatically increased number of routers/sites using these techniques instead of redesigning the network when additional sites or wiring configurations are added The course contains seven modules and 16 main lab exercises.
