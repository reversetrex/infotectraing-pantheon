Do students really have a clear picture of what a million is? A billion? 
What about fractions, decimals, and percents? Can students actually 
picture these concepts in their minds? This course provides unforgettable 
visual images that establish a context in which students can better 
explore number sense. Using an investigative reporting format, the student 
views various areas where numbers are used and number sense is important. 
Classroom activities and posters extend and reinforce what the course has 
put in motion.
