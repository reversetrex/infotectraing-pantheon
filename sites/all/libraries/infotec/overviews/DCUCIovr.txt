This intensive five-day, hands-on course focuses on Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) deployment and operations. You will learn how to install, configure, manage, and troubleshoot Cisco UCS B-Series blade servers and C-Series rack-mount servers with consolidated I/O networking for LAN and SAN connectivity, and how to virtualize server properties to enable simple and rapid mobility of server images between physical servers. In labs, you will practice implementing a realistic, hierarchical management model, configuring fault tolerance (at the LAN, SAN, and server network interface card [NIC] level), backing up and restoring system configurations, and using the built-in monitoring and troubleshooting tools in Cisco UCS Manager and the Cisco Integrated Management Controller. You will also install and configure the Cisco Nexus 1000V Distributed Virtual Switch and VMware Pass- Through Switching (PTS), leveraging VMware vSphere 4.1 on Cisco UCS B-Series and CSeries infrastructure.
