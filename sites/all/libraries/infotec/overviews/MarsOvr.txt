<p>The Cisco Security Monitoring Analysis and Response System (CS-MARS) is part of the Cisco Security Management Suite which provides security monitoring for network security devices and host application made by Cisco or non-Cisco providers. In addition to event correlation and data reduction features found in SIM products, CS-MARS also provides topology awareness and automatic mitigation features. In knowing the topology of a network, CS-MARS can determine where the attack is originating and apply the appropriate remediation. CS-MARS is a key component in the Cisco Self Defending Network strategy. CS-MARS exchanges information with CS-Manager to provide a unified security management solution. For example, an administrator can view IPS signatures or the Firewall block / permit syslog messages received from sensors or firewalls. CS-MARS will communicate with CS-Manager and display the IPS signature table or firewall rule table. From there the IPS signature or firewall rule can be modified as necessary. Together CS-MARS and CS-Manager provide a unified management solution for monitoring and provisioning.</p>
