Adobe® Illustrator CS6 gives you new features like the touch type tool, 
font search, and CSS extraction. LearnKey's Illustrator course will teach 
you everything you need to know to create vector assets which can be used 
in any design project ranging from logos to graphics used in advertising. 
You will learn to intuitively combine, edit, and fill shapes directly on 
their artboard without accessing multiple tools and panels. At the 
completion of this course you will be prepared for the Graphic Design and 
Illustration with Adobe Illustrator CS6 exam.
