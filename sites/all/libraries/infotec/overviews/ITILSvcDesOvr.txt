This Lifecycle course looks at the whole Service Design stage from at a management level. The Service Design stage creates new or changed services that meet customer requirements and will have a strong enough "warranty" to provide business value. Service Design is also responsible for negotiating and piloting service level and underpinning agreements. The course explores the goals, objectives, processes, common activities and technologies needed to ready a service for transition into the live environment. The course culminates with the ITIL Intermediate Service Design certification examination.
