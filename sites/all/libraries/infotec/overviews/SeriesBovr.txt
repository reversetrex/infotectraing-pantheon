<p>As a manager, you are responsible for setting the goals for your team and for managing their work. Organizational goals can often get lost in layers of management and not get communicated to the individual contributors. In the absence of goals, employees can feel unmotivated or can even set their own goals for achievement, which will result in poor and conflicting team performance. In this course, you will develop skills needed to establish tactical goals for your team based on organizational directives and general goals from your manager and create and manage action plans to achieve these goals.</p>
