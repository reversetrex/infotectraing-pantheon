This course offers students a chance to develop their communication skills 
in all types of relationships. A series of scenarios describe typical 
conflicts between friends, siblings, parents and children, and an employee 
and boss. A leading adolescent psychologist helps students understand the 
scenarios by showing how maximizing communication, listening, and 
mediation skills can help to resolve most conflicts. Students take turns 
figuring out what they would do to enhance the communication and resolve 
the conflict for each situation.
