The Exchange Server 2007 Configuration course from LearnKey is targeted at network administrators already working with Exchange 2000 and 2003. Expert Aaron Spurlock teaches exactly what Microsoft wants network administrators to know from a certification standpoint, including Exchange Management Shell Console, changes in Active Directory, and real-world simulations that begin in a 2003 environment. Walk through a 2007 upgrade, followed by the 2003 removal process and by the end of the course you'll be comfortable rolling out Exchange 2007 in your environment.
