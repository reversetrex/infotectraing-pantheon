The breadth of business, educational, and organizational information in existence today is absolutely staggering. Organizations the world over rely on this information to make sound decisions regarding all manner of affairs. But with the amount of available data growing on a daily basis, the ability to make sense of all of that data is becoming more and more challenging. Fortunately, the days of performing calculations and analyzing data on paper are pretty much gone. Imagine, if you will, having to calculate what percentage of your organization's sales occurred in one small town in, say, Brazil. If your organization operates in multiple countries and generates billions of dollars in revenue annually, it could take a lifetime to isolate the exact figures you need and then compare those to the rest of your revenues. Who has that kind of time? This is exactly where the power of Excel can help.<br><br>
By applying the robust functionality that's built into Excel to your organization's raw data, you will be able to gain a level of insight into that data that would have been nearly impossible just a couple of decades ago. Excel can help you organize, calculate, analyze, revise, update, and present your data in ways that will help the decision makers in your organization steer you in the right direction. Of course, knowing exactly how to ask Excel the questions that you need answered, which questions you can even ask, and how to interpret the answers Excel gives is necessary before you can even begin to embark on the journey ahead. This course aims to provide you with the foundational Excel knowledge and skills necessary to begin that journey. This course covers Microsoft Office Specialist exam objectives to help students prepare for the Excel 2013 Exam and the Excel 2013 Expert Exam.
