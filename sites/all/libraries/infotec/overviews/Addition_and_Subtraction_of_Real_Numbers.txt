In this course, students will compare and contrast the properties of 
numbers and number systems, including rational and real numbers, and 
understand complex numbers as solutions to quadratic equations that do not 
have real solutions. An instructor with infectious energy and enthusiasm, 
Professor Terry Caliste will teach students to understand the meaning and 
effects of arithmetic operations with fractions, decimals, and integers. 
Students can actively work out problems to sharpen their own skills with 
the included worksheets.
