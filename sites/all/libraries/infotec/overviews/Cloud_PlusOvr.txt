The CompTIA Cloud+ Certification is an internationally recognized validation of the knowledge required of IT Practitioners working in a cloud computing Environment.   Our CompTIA Cloud+ Boot Camp offers a proven study system to prepare for the CompTIA Cloud+ Certification exam, the professional level exam that aims to validate the skills and knowledge required of IT personnel working in Cloud Computing Environments. Readers will gain the knowledge and skills required to understand cloud computing terminology; to implement, maintain, and deliver cloud technologies and cloud implementations and the application of virtualization.<br><br>
With our Cloud+ Boot Camp we offer our instructor led course on the first four days of class.  Our blended learning Infotec Knowledge Accelerator is available online for students to use for evening study, for quizzes/practice exams and for instructor chat while prepping at night for the Security+ Certification test. On Friday we offer a final review and the option of testing in the classroom.  For individuals who would like to take more time to prep for the exam, Infotec offers a booster policy where students who purchase a course can sit the same class on our public schedule a second time for additional study (at no charge). Students who decide not to test on Friday can take the exam in one of our testing centers on a later date. Our Infotec Knowledge Accelerator will be available for students to use for additional study for two weeks after attending our Cloud+ Boot Camp. Our Boot Camp includes our Cloud+ instructor led class; custom designed Infotec Knowledge Accelerator for test prep, practice quizzes and instructor chat; the certification exam (if purchased) and booster policy (if needed).<br><br>
