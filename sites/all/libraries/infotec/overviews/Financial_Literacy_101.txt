Financial mastery is like a puzzle - it's only possible when you have all 
the pieces in hand, and know how to fit them together in the right order. 
Financial Literacy 101 will teach you important financial concepts about 
spending, savings, credit and taxes and show you how to apply those 
principles in a systematic order that will provide a solid foundation for 
financial success.
