This course is designed to help students who need to sharpen their skills 
or as a resource that teachers can employ to help struggling students stay 
up to speed. Energetic and enthusiastic Professor Terry Caliste teaches 
students step-by-step to use symbolic algebra to represent situations and 
to solve problems, especially those that involve linear relationships. At 
the conclusion of this course, students will be able to write equivalent 
forms of equations, inequalities, and systems of equations and solve them 
with fluency - mentally or with paper and pencil in simple cases and using 
technology in all cases.
