Security+ is the primary course you will need to take if your job responsibilities include securing network services, network devices, and network traffic.  With our Security+ Boot Camp we offer our instructor led course on the first four days of class.  On the morning of the last day we administer our online practice exam and for those who pass at a score of 90% or higher we offer the option of taking the certification test in the classroom in the afternoon.  For those who do not pass with a score of 90% or higher we offer our e-learning course for additional study at no charge.   Infotec also offers a booster policy where students who purchase a course can sit the same class on our public schedule a second time for additional study (at no charge).  Once the 90% rate on our pre-test is achieved, we recommend taking the certification exam.  Our Boot Camp includes our Security + instructor led class, practice test, certification exam (if purchased), and e-learning course/booster policy (if needed).
