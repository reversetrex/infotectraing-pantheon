The Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification, from the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium ISC2 is considered by some to be the single most important step for many security professionals. The CISSP credential is earned by passing a CISSP examination composed of 250 multiple-choice questions. The exam questions are based on what ISC2 refers to as the common body of knowledge (CBK). With this metric, an accomplished and experienced security professional should have a foundation in all 10 areas of the CBK.
