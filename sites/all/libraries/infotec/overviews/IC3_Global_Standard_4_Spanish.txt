Bridge your digital divide with LearKey's new Spanish IC3 Global Standard 
4 (GS4). This course allows Spanish speaking students to learn computing 
skills by hearing their native language while seeing computer terms in 
English. The course teaches important skills for competency in computing 
fundamentals (hardware, software, and using an operating system), key 
applications (common program functions, word processing, and spreadsheet 
functions) and living online (networks and the Internet, email, and the 
impact of computing on society). In addition to the IC3 core standards, 
this course also covers material related to the ICT curriculum.
