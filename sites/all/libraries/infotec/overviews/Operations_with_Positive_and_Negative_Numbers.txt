As part of the Basic Math series, Operations with Positive and Negative 
Numbers will help students catch up and build confidence in their math 
skills, or give motivated students an extra edge. In this course, the 
student will begin with number lines, integers and absolute value then 
move on to adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing integers and 
conclude with order of operations. Every detail is covered and included 
worksheets allow the student to work along with the on-screen tutors to 
sharpen skills through practice tests.
