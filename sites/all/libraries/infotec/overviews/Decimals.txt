Michael Cain, a creative, enthusiastic teacher, will help struggling 
students catch up and build confidence in their math skills, or give 
motivated students an extra edge. In this course, the student will begin 
with place value and progress through converting and comparing decimals 
and fractions to comparing, ordering, rounding and estimating decimals, 
and conclude with adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing decimals. 
Every detail is covered and included worksheets allow the student to work 
along with the on-screen tutors to sharpen skills through practice tests.
