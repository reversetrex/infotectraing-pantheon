The goal of this course is to provide Microsoft Visual Basic developers with the knowledge and skills needed to develop Microsoft .NET-based applications by using Visual Basic .NET version 7.0. Visual Basic .NET is a significant upgrade to Visual Basic and incorporates many new features and framework goals of the .NET architecture. These changes will allow Visual Basic developers to create enterprise applications for the .NET Platform and to create more traditional Visual Basic applications that can take advantage of the enhancements to the language.
