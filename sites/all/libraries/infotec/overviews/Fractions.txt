Michael Cain, a creative, enthusiastic teacher, will help students catch 
up and build confidence in their math skills, or give motivated students 
an extra edge. By dividing up objects and comparing the parts, students 
get a hands-on understanding of what a fraction is. This training course 
shows students how to generate a series of equivalent fractions and use it 
to compare different fractions and solve other real-world problems. Lively 
examples present ways of dividing groups of discrete units, volumes, and 
areas into parts.
