<p>Microsoft Operations Framework (MOF) 4.0 is a best practices framework designed to help IT organizations better serve their customers and users. MOF 4.0 builds off of previous versions and can be implemented independently or with other frameworks, such as ITIL and CobiT. This course covers the foundations of MOF and the IT Service Management Lifecycle.</p>

<p>MOF consists of sixteen Service Management Functions (SMFs) that reside in three lifecycle phases, Plan, Deliver, Operate, and an encompassing Manage Layer. MOF is designed to allow an IT organization to implement in bits and pieces or as a carefully orchestrated program. The MOF practical guidance goes beyond theory to help users establish and implement reliable, cost-effective IT services, practices and activities. The knowledge gained in this MOF course applies to all organizations, regardless of the platforms or applications in use, and provides professionals with access to valuable content, templates and job aids.</p>
