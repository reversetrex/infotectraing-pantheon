This 5-day course is structured to following the CISM review manual and examination flow.  A full day is provided for each of the core competencies and associated task and knowledge statements, thereby ensuring a detailed and thorough coverage of all areas that will be tested.  The fundamental thrust of the examination is on understanding the concepts, not on memorizing facts.  As a result, the course will be presented in an interactive manner to ensure the underlying concepts are understood and examination questions can be analyzed properly to achieve the correct answer.
