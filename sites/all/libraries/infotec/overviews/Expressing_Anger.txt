This course helps students identify inappropriate angry behaviors and 
learn new ways to cope with these strong emotions. Students will observe 
real teens participating in a workshop led by a clinical psychologist. 
After these teens act out the different ways we all express anger, 
students are challenged to identify their own styles of anger expression 
and are encouraged to examine why they express anger the way they do. 
Students are encouraged to find new and healthier ways to express their 
anger.
