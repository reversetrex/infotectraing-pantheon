This course describes the various components of System Center and how to deploy, monitor and manage a service and prepackaged applications in to the private cloud as well as automating incident creation, remediation and change requests.<br /><br />


This course provides an overview of a private cloud infrastructure, the business and technical drivers behind the implementation, and how System Center 2012 can be used to monitor and operate the private cloud infrastructure. Students will learn how to configure and optimize a new business unit cloud as well as how to deploy pre-packaged applications and create a new service template to deploy a service into the cloud.

Students will learn about the core functionality of Service Manager and learn how to create and manage change requests, incidents, and release records as well as the security model behind Service Manager.<br /><br />


Students will also learn about problem management and how to use it within a service management framework using Service Manager. They will perform custom event monitoring in Operations Manager and then use it to identify and route incidents and problems to Service Manager, providing automatic incident creation, remediation and change requests. Students will learn how to provide automated self service provisioning and how to protect and recover the resources in the private cloud. Students will learn how to implement IT Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) in a private cloud. They will configure the environment to verify whether key private cloud infrastructure is correctly patched and updated, and will check for compliance across key Service Components and remediate non-compliant items. Students will learn how to provide surfacing service and performance-related data and how to optimize Cloud Resources.
