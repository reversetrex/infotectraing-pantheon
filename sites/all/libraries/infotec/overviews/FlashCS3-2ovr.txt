As a web developer, you want to create engaging experiences for the visitors to your sites. Thus far, you have probably created straightforward HTML or Flash files with simple animations using prebuilt components. In this course, you will create rich Internet applications with Adobe Flash CS3 using ActionScript. The site you create will pull data from external sources, so it will respond to user choices based on the information in those files. You will also manage forms, perform calculations, and tailor the interface using ActionScript programming.
