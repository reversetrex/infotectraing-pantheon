<p>In almost every office around the world, people communicate and share ideas to create products and services. This information sharing often requires multiple software and web applications that do not necessarily work together perfectly. In contrast, Windows SharePoint services combines familiar office tools, adds the latest technology, and extends the functionality of applications and the web into a single environment to share information and collaborate with colleagues, no matter where you are or how you access the information. In this course, you will create and edit content in a Windows SharePoint Services team website, and then you will create and manage your own team site as a site owner and as a SharePoint Services administrator.</p>
