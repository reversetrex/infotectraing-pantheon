Microsoft Project 2003: Level 2 is the second course in the Microsoft Project 2003 series. In Microsoft Project 2003: Level 1, students used project management skills to create a complete project plan. This course will build upon that knowledge, and give the opportunity to work with a project plan once it has entered the project implementation phase.
