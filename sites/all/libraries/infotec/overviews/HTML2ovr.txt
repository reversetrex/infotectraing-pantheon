This course is designed to introduce developers to the elements, attributes, and development techniques of HTML 4.01, particularly those elements and attributes that are only supported by Netscape Navigator 6.0 and later and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 and later. Many elements and attributes in HTML 4.01 have rarely been used due to lack of browser support. These new features add a new level of power, flexibility, and accessibility to Web documents. With the introduction of more standards-compliant browsers, developers can now use these new techniques to build more efficient, usable, and standards-compliant Web sites.
