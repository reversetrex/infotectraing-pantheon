You will set Photoshop's unit preferences and save files in different formats to see how well each one balances image quality with file size reduction. You will then calibrate your system's color display. You will also use Photoshop as part of creating finished web pages and export individual slices and create an HTML Web page that displays a table containing the sliced sections. Finally, you will use Photoshop and the Save for Web Devices feature to create and optimize animations for the web and mobile devices.
