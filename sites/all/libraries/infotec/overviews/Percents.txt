Michael Cain, a creative, enthusiastic teacher, will help students catch 
up and build confidence in their math skills, or give motivated students 
an extra edge. In this course, students will begin with converting between 
decimals and percents and equivalent expressions, move on to expressing 
ratios as percents, finding the percent or base of a number and conclude 
with simple interest. Every detail is covered and included worksheets 
allow the student to work along with the on-screen tutors to sharpen 
skills through practice tests.
