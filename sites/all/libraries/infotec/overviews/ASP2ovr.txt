Active Server Pages Advanced Topics introduces advanced concepts and techniques of ASP programming while building basic ASP applications. It assumes a knowledge of the basics of the ASP, ADO, and Scripting Objects object models-all of which were covered in Level 1. Learning to leverage that knowledge to build actual ASP applications is no easy task, but upon completing this course you should feel comfortable building interesting applications. While working on the various projects of the course you'll be introduced to new aspects of the object models, additional scripting techniques, and numerous performance issues.
