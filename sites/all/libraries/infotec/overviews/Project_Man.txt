This training teaches you the four phases of a project's life cycle, planning for quality, time and cost to make the best use of your resources. You will go through the steps to control your work-in-progress with interim reviews and bring your project to a successful conclusion. The principles of project management are applicable at all levels of an organization. Whether you are managing a construction project, software development, office relocation or a class reunion, your project will run more smoothly using these methods.
