In this course, students will learn to analyze problems by identifying 
relationships, distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information, 
sequencing and prioritizing information, and observing patterns. At the 
conclusion of this course, students will be able to indicate the relative 
advantages of exact and approximate solutions to problems and give answers 
to a specified degree of accuracy and be able to apply them in other 
circumstances. Classroom activities and worksheets will involve students 
in learning about the problem-solving process.
