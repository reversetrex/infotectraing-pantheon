CVOICE lays the foundation for gaining hand-on skills and significant understanding of packet telephony by presenting the technologies that are common for both Enterprise and Service Provider students. The course also teaches students how to use the available Cisco tools to find the information needed to accomplish their everyday tasks. Since no two networks are alike, this approach enables a student to apply the knowledge gained in this course to their specific needs.
