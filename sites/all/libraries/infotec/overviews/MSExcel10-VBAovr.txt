In the previous Excel courses, you used Excel to simplify business tasks, including the creation of spreadsheets, graphs, charts, and formulas that were difficult to create and nearly impossible to maintain using pencil and paper. You now want to simplify your work in the Excel environment by automating many of the repetitive tasks that are part of spreadsheet development. In Excel 2010 VBA you apply the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language to simplify many of the tasks you learned in Excel 2010 Level 1 and Excel 2010 Level 2.
