The Implementing CiscoWorks LMS (CWENT) v3.0 course teaches students how to effectively use the CiscoWorks applications contained in the LMS 3.0-3.01 bundle. The focus is on finding the correct tools within CiscoWorks to document the network, log changes that occur, deploy global changes to devices, monitor network performance, and manage network faults. The labs are designed around students sharing two CiscoWorks servers set up in a Multi-Server Trust environment.
