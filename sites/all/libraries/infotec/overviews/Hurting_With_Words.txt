This course is designed to raise awareness of a very real, yet often 
overlooked, form of abuse: emotional violence. Hurtful words include 
threats, bullying, and intimidation-anything which causes feelings of 
humiliation, fear, or worthlessness on the part of the victim. You'll 
examine the causes of many different types of emotional abuse: men to 
women, husbands to wives, parents to children, adults to children, and 
group to group. At the conclusion of this course, you'll be aware of many 
successful methods of dealing with verbally or emotionally abusive people.
