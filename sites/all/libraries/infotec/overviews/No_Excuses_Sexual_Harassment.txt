This course uses a series of real-life scenarios to demonstrate various 
kinds of sexual harassment in the school environment. Examples presented 
range from indirect forms of harassment (such as unwanted propositions, 
rumor spreading and name calling) to more blatant kinds like physical 
blocking or touching. Real-life teens describe their experiences with 
sexual harassment and a Sexual Harassment Officer suggests options and 
resources students can seek to help them deal with an unwanted situation 
once it has been identified.
