Number concepts like fractions or percents often act as a barrier for 
students, keeping them from realizing their full potential in mathematics. 
This course teaches students to identify and solve word problems with 
proportions and to develop, analyze, and explain methods for solving 
problems involving proportions, such as scaling and finding equivalent 
ratios. Energetic and enthusiastic Professor Terry Caliste gives a clear 
presentation with comprehensive activities to help motivate students to 
raise their own expectations for success in math.
