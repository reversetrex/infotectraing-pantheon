The first segment of this course, Just Another Day, is a live-action drama 
which recreates the events that have typically led up to tragic, violent 
outbursts such as those that have exploded in schools across the country. 
The second segment, Perspectives on School Violence: A Teacher's Resource, 
features violence prevention authorities discussing topics like 
identifying potentially violent students, creating a comprehensive plan to 
prevent violence, creating a safe school environment and why it's 
important to involve the entire school community in this effort.
