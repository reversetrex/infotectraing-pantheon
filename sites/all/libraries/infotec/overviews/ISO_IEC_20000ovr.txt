Since 2005, ISO/IEC 20000 (also referred to as ISO 20000) has been the international standard for IT Service Management (ITSM). The ISO/IEC 20000 Certificate, which is issued to organizations, not individuals, confirms the organization has demonstrated sufficient evidence of a quality ITSM Program.<br><br>
For organizations not immediately seeking ISO/IEC 20000 certification, the training provides an international standard of best practices against which to benchmark your current ITSM and Service Quality Management programs.  Some of the biggest challenges faced when implementing Service Management are: 1) getting the attention and commitment of senior management and 2) ensuring acceptance and adoption of managed change throughout the organization.  These hurdles may be overcome more quickly by using this standard to benchmark capability of delivering managed services, measure service levels and assess performance.<br><br>
For companies actively seeking ISO/IEC 20000 Certification as a competitive advantage, Foundation training helps accelerate the audit process by partially meeting the standard's "Competency, Awareness and Training" requirements.
