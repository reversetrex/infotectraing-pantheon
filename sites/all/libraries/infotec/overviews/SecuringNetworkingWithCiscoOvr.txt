The Securing Networks with Cisco Routers and Switches (SECURE) 1.0 course is an instructor-led course that is presented by Cisco Learning Partners to their end-user customers. This five-day course aims at providing network security engineers with the knowledge and skills they need to secure Cisco IOS Software router-and switch-based networks, and provide security services that are based on Cisco IOS Software. Successful graduates will be able to secure the network environment using existing Cisco IOS Software features. In addition, they will be able to install and configure components of the Cisco IOS Software, such as a zone-based policy firewall, Cisco IOS Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), and a user-based firewall. They will also be able to install secure tunnels using IP Security (IPsec) virtual private network (VPN) technology.<br/><br/>

This technology includes public key infrastructure (PKI), virtual tunnel interface (VTI) and dynamic virtual tunnel interface (DVTI), Group Encrypted Transport VPN (GET VPN), Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network (DMVPN), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN, and advanced switch security features. The course focuses on the implementation and troubleshooting aspects of the Lifecycle Services approach, adding some elements of the design phase as well.
