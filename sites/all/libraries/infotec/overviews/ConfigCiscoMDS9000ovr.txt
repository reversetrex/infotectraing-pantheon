This course covers features on each of the MDS 9000 Series product family of switches including the 9100, 9200, 9500, and 9700 models and the Fibre Channel, Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), and service modules supported. Fundamental topics include 8-Gbps Fibre Channel, 16-Gbps Fibre Channel, Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP), multihop FCoE, upgrading the Cisco NX-OS, and the common management tool Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM). The course provides comprehensive SAN configuration for features such as interface configuration, Cisco N-Port Virtualizer (NPV), N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV), virtual SAN (VSAN) and domain setup, SAN zoning, and SAN extension using FCIP and Inter-VSAN Routing (IVR). Topics introduced also include centralized SAN services using the Cisco MDS 9222i Multiservice Modular Switch and Cisco MDS 9250i Multiservice Fabric Switch for Cisco I/O Acceleration (IOA) and Cisco Data Mobility Manager (DMM), management security and role-based access control (RBAC) topics. The goal of this course is to help students understand how to apply these new technologies to optimize the scalability, agility, performance, and operational efficiency of the SAN.
