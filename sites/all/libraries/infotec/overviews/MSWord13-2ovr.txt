After completing the first course in this series, Microsoft Office Word 2013: Level 1, you are now able to perform the basic tasks to create a variety of documents. You probably noticed as you continued working in Word that there are some tasks that you repeat quite often. This course will show you how you can work more efficiently by automating some tasks and providing methods to maintain consistency between documents. You will create more complex documents that include lists, tables, charts, graphics, and newsletter layouts. You will also merge data into documents to personalize correspondence and address envelopes and labels with the data as well.<br><br>
Word can be used to create complex documents that are nearly as complicated as those created using a desktop publishing application. Using Word, you can control how the text flows between paragraphs and pages, you can link a story on page one to the rest of the story later in the document, and you can add graphics and specify how the text and graphic appear together on the page. You can also use this course to prepare for the Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) Certification exams for Microsoft Word 2013.
