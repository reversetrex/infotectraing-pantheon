This three-day instructor-led course provides students with the necessary knowledge to work with all the associated SharePoint business intelligence services including PerformancePoint Service, Excel Services, Business Connectivity Services, and Visio Services. The new and improved Business Intelligence Center is explored, and all the exciting new features within the SharePoint 2013 release are covered. The focus of this course is on the SharePoint 2013 business intelligence platform and not on the SQL business intelligence services. As far as possible each of the modules is stand-alone allowing for customization of the course for those audiences that may not have an interest in a certain service.
