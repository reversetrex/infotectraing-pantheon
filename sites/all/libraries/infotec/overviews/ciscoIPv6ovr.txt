This course is a 5-day, instructor led training course that provides baseline technical information and training on the next-generation Internet protocol, IPv6. This course will help network engineers understand, configure, and support Cisco devices running IOS software. This course covers the fundamentals of IPv6; routing protocols such as RIPng, OSPF, BGP, and IS-IS; IPv6 transition mechanisms including tunnels, ISATAP, NAT-PT, and 6to4; and other features. This course takes the student to the next levels of designing and deploying IPv6 networks based on the current standards and practices.<br /><br />IPv6 is the new Internet Protocol specification and implementation that uses 128 bit addressing where IPv4 uses 32 bits. This presents many new areas of expertise for network designers and administrators to learn and experience. The IPVSD course has in depth coverage of IPv6 design and deployment for DNS, DHCP, integrating IPv6 in an IPv4 network, Multicast, and much more.
