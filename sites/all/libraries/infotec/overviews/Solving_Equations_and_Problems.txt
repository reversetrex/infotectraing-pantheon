This course is designed to help students who need to sharpen their skills 
or as a resource that teachers can employ to help struggling students stay 
up to speed. Energetic and enthusiastic Professor Terry Caliste teaches 
students step-by-step to first simplify the equation or problem, solve the 
equation using one step or two, and how to solve equations with a variable 
on both sides of the equation. At the conclusion of this course, students 
will be able to write equivalent forms of equations, inequalities, and 
systems of equations and solve them with fluency.
