The primary goal of IT Service Management is to deliver quality IT services that enable desired business outcomes. To do this, service providers often face a precarious balancing act of managing customer relationships and requirements, understanding and managing demand and patterns of business activities, aligning internal and external suppliers and maintaining fiscal responsibility and sound IT investments. The ITIL Capability Course - Service Offerings and Agreements (SOA) - provides the best practice process knowledge required to navigate these waters towards the safe harbor of customer satisfaction and continual service improvement.
