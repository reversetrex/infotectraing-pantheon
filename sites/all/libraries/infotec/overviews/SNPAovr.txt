Securing Networks with PIX and ASA (SNPA) v5.0 is an update to SNPA v4.0, an existing five-day instructor-led course on using the Cisco ASA and PIX Security Appliance software version 7.0 to protect network systems from intrusions and security threats. The SNPA 5.0 course introduces the new ASA 5505 and 5550 and covers important new ASA and PIX Security Appliance 7.2 features, including the following: new and enhanced inspection engines for application layer protocol inspection; packet tracer; CSC-SSM; resource management for security contexts; enhanced VPN services such as SSL VPN Client and Citrix support for WebVPN. The SNPA 7.0 course takes a task-oriented approach to teaching the skills to deploy, configure, and administer the Cisco ASA and PIX Security Appliances.
