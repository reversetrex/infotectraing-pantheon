With our Security+ 2008 Exam Prep Boot Camp we offer our instructor led course on the first two days of class. Our blended learning Moodle is available online for students to use for evening study, quizzes/practice tests and instructor chat while prepping at night for the Security + Certification exam. We will offer a pretest at the beginning of class to help our instructor determine areas to emphasize in our Boot Camp. Reviews of the content covered in class and the Moodle activity of the night before are also included in our Security+ Refresh Boot Camp. On the morning of the third day we offer a final review and the option of testing in the classroom. Students who decide not to test on the last day can take the exam in one of Infotec’s testing centers on a later date. Infotec’s Moodle will be available for students to use for additional study for several weeks after attending our Refresh Boot Camp.
