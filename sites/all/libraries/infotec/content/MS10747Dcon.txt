<p><strong>Module 7: Creating and Deploying Applications</strong> - The System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager application deployment model enhances the capabilities of packages and programs for delivery of software to Windows operating systems, the Mac operating system (Mac OS X), and mobile devices. When deploying to Windows, System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager, in addition to packages and programs, uses Configuration Manager applications. These applications are best for deploying installer-based software, such as Windows installations that are .msi-file based. This is because they provide a more intelligent software deployment model.</p>
<p>With the Configuration Manager application deployment model, you can create a single deployment for Windows-based clients and mobile device clients that provide different installation options depending on specifically defined conditions. For example, you can install an application locally on user’s primary devices and deploy a virtual version of the application when they are on other devices, all through the same deployment. You can do this by using features such as requirements and dependencies. Additional features, such as state-based reporting and detection methods, can help you create intelligent deployments.</p>
<p>In this module, you will learn about the application model and the basics for creating, deploying, and managing applications with Configuration Manager. You will also learn how to use Configuration Manager Software Center and Configuration Manager Application Catalog to install available applications.</p>
