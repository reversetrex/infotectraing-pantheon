  <li>Creating Dynamic Packages</li>
  <li>Using Containers</li>
  <li>Managing Consistency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module 6: Debugging and Troubleshooting SSIS Packages</strong></p>
<p>This module describes how you can debug SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages to find the cause of errors that occur during execution. Then module then covers the logging functionality built into SSIS you can use to log events for troubleshooting purposes. Finally, the module describes common approaches for handling errors in control flow and data flow.</p>

  <li>Debugging an SSIS Package</li>
  <li>Logging SSIS Package Events</li>
  <li>Handling Errors in an SSIS Package</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module 7: Implementing an Incremental ETL Process</strong></p>
<p>This module describes the techniques you can use to implement an incremental data warehouse refresh process.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to Incremental ETL</li>
  <li>Extracting Modified Data</li>
  <li>Loading Modified Data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module 8: Incorporating Data from the Cloud into a Data Warehouse</strong></p>
<p>In this module, you will learn about how you can use cloud computing in your data warehouse infrastructure and learn about the tools and services available from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of Cloud Data Sources</li>
  <li>SQL Server Database</li>
  <li>The Windows Azure Marketplace</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module 9: Enforcing Data Quality</strong></p>
<p>Ensuring the high quality of data is essential if the results of data analysis are to be trusted. This module explains how to use the SQL Server 2012 Data Quality Services (DQS) to provide a computer assisted process for cleansing data values and identifying and removing duplicate data entities.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to Data Quality</li>
  <li>Using Data Quality Services to Cleanse Data</li>
  <li>Using Data Quality Services to Match Data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module 10: Using Master Data Services</strong></p>
<p>This module introduces Master Data Services and explains the benefits of using it in a data warehousing context. The module also describes the key configuration options for Master Data Services, and explains how to import and   export data. Finally, the module explains how to apply rules that help to preserve data integrity, and introduces the new Master Data Services Add-in for Excel.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduction to Master Data Services</li>
  <li>Implementing a Master Data Services Model</li>
  <li>Using the Master Data Services Add-in for Excel</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module 11: Extending SQL Server Integration Services</strong></p>
<p>This module describes the techniques you can use to extend SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). The module is not designed to be a comprehensive guide to developing custom SSIS solutions, but to provide an awareness of the   fundamental steps required to use custom components and scripts in an ETL process that is based on SSIS.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using Custom Components in SSIS</li>
  <li>Using Scripts in SSIS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module 12: Deploying and Configuring SSIS Packages</strong></p>
<p>SQL Server Integration Services provides tools that make it easy to deploy packages to another computer. The deployment tools also manage any dependencies,   such as configurations and files that the package needs. In this module, you will learn how to use these tools to install packages and their dependencies on a target computer.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Overview of SSIS Deployment</li>
  <li>Deploying SSIS Projects</li>
