<p><strong>Module 1: Service Management Overview</strong> - Effective IT Service Management includes process-driven methodologies that cover a broad spectrum of IT functions. This can include change management, incident and problem management and release management. Although no organization typically adopts any single IT Service Management methodology most organizations, depending on their size and nature of business will adopt a combination of processes and functions from many different IT Service Management frameworks such as ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library or MOF (Microsoft Operations Framework.</p>
<p>In this module you will learn many of the ITIL and MOF best practices and procedures in delivering effective IT Service Management and how System Center 2012 Service Manager can be used to implement them in your organization.</p>

<p><strong>Module 2: Installing System Center 2012 SP1 Service Manager</strong> - Before installing System Center 2012 SP1 Service Manager in any environment there are many factors that you need to consider. Firstly, you need to understand your current IT environment. This includes how many users and computers are in the environment, how many Incidents and Change Requests are raised on a weekly/monthly basis and how many Analysts will be using the Service Manager Console. This information is critical in planning a successful deployment of Service Manager as it will be used to determine the hardware required for the various Service Manager components. Service Manager relies on Microsoft SQL Server to stores it&rsquo;s operational and data warehouse databases so careful consideration should also be given to the configuration of SQL Server when deploying Service Manager. This includes the disk subsystem, memory and database collation. In this module you will learn the key component and architecture of Service Manager including the hardware and software requirements. You will also learn the security requirements and considerations that should be taken into account before, during and after deploying Service Manager. You will learn how to install the various components of Service Manager including where components can and cannot be shared on the same computer.

<p><strong>Module 3: Configuring base settings in Service Manager</strong> - After installing Service Manager in your environment there will be number of base configuration tasks that should be performed in order to customize it to your environment and your needs. For example, you will need to create an Active Directory Connector that imports Users and Groups from the Active directory Domain. This will be required so that you can assign Work Items such as Incidents to users in the organization. It is also important to secure access to Service Manager so that only the relevant people can use its functions. This involves creating User Roles using User Role profiles so that when users open the Service Manager Console it is scoped based on their role. Notifications should be configured so that relevant staff can be notified when service levels are breached or when Incidents have been assigned to them. Finally, in order to integrate Service Manager with other System Center components such as Operations Manager and Orchestrator you will need to create Connectors for these components. The Connector will be used to import objects and use them as Configuration Items in Service Manager so that they can be associated with Work Items such as Incidents and Change Requests. In this module you will learn how to apply base configuration to Service Manager so that it is customized to your environment.</p>
