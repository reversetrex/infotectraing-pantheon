<p><strong>Module 3: Designing  the Physical Structure of SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This  module describes file placement considerations for different functionalities in  SQL Server 2008, which helps to improve performance and availability. This module  covers the use of partitioning to improve database performance. This module  also describes the importance of full-text indexing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Module 4: Designing  a Strategy for Maintaining a Database in SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This  module describes the importance of keeping the database up-to-date and the  database performing in optimal state. This includes keeping statistics updated  and ensuring that a proper index is deployed and implemented. This module also  covers the use of database compression to save the disk consumption and to  improve the overall performance of a database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Module 5: Designing  Solutions for Managing SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This  module describes the new approach of managing SQL Servers that has been  introduced in SQL Server 2008. It also describes the importance of having a  centralized administrative model in your organization by implementing  policy-based management. This module also describes how to prevent accidental  database changes by using DDL triggers and how to use Change Data Capture (CDC)  to monitor data changes in the database for compliance reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Module 6:  Automating the Database Management Strategy for SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This  module describes the use of SQL Server Agent and scripts, such as VBScripts and  SQL PowerShell, to automate some routine jobs which administrators perform  often. This module also covers the use of event notification that helps you to  monitor your database for specific events and notify the administrator when the  event occurs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Module 7: Designing  a Strategy for Securing SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This  module presents information related to database access control and how SQL  Server manages keys and certificates. This module also covers the use of  database encryptions to prevent application data from being accessed by  unauthorized users, including administrators.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Module 8: Designing  a Strategy for Monitoring SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This  module describes the information on monitoring a SQL Server 2008 server to  ensure that it is performing properly and is in a healthy state. This module  also presents information on how to determine if there are any potential  problems on the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Module 9: Designing  a Strategy for Content Distribution in SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This  module describes the different methods of distributing data to multiple servers.  This module describes how to use remote query with linked server and the  considerations of using distributed transactions on query span across multiple  servers.Â  This module also discusses the  use of SSIS to perform data transportation between servers and it covers the  method for troubleshooting SSIS packages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Module 10:  Designing a Strategy for Replication in SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This  module provides more in-depth discussions on using replication. This module  also talks about using replication, specifically snapshot and transactional  replication, which is one-way replication, to replicate data to other servers.  Finally, this module describes the way to set up merge and peer-to-peer  replication, which should be used for multi-update origin scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Module 11:  Designing a High-Availability Solution for SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  This  module describes the different high-availability features available in SQL  Server 2008. The module then covers the scenarios of using them in an  organization. This module also covers the considerations for choosing the right  high-availability solution for an organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Module 12:  Designing a Backup and Recovery Strategy for SQL Server 2008</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This module describes  the importance of having a backup of your database. In case of a disaster,  backing up the database helps to recover data that cannot be protected by using  HA solutions mentioned in the previous module. This module also describes  different online operations supported by SQL Server 2008, which helps to  minimize the downtime when data restore is required. This module also describes  the steps to repair system databases that are corrupted.</p>
