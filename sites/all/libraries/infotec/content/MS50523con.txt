<p><strong>Module 4: Deploying Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 2010 to New Computers</strong></p>
<p>This module explains how to deploy   Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 2010 to new or bare-metal computers by using the   Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) and Microsoft System Center Configuration   Manager. The module provides an overview of the deployment process and typical   post-deployment tasks. It also explains the steps that you must perform to   deploy the Windows Optimized Desktop by using the MDT and compares these steps   with the steps that you use to deploy by using System Center Configuration   Manager with MDT integration. Finally, the module describes the main tasks that   you must perform when you use System Center Configuration Manager without the MDT for Windows and Office 2010 deployments.</p>
