<p><strong>Module 2: The Business Intelligence Stack</strong></p>
<blockquote>In this module we will first look at the three different ways in which business intelligence can be viewed. Then, weâ€™re going to look at the services SQL 2012 provides us and how they apply to business intelligence. We will then move to SharePoint 2013 and look at the SharePoint services to examine their relevance and how we can use them in business intelligence to surface data. In this section we will also cover the new business intelligence features available within the SharePoint 2013 release. Finally, we will take a brief look at PowerPivot, examining the new features and their significance. PowerPivot is covered in more detail in a later module.</blockquote>
