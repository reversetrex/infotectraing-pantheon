<p><strong>Module 5: Advanced Data Scenarios in a Windows Store App</strong></p>
<blockquote>In this module, you will learn about the new file storage capabilities of Windows 8.1.In addition, you will learn how to use the file storage capabilities in your apps. You will also learn how to design and implement more useful data storage through caching and how to set up file extensions, associations, and compression. These features will help you to provide a better experience to the user by increasing the responsiveness of your app, and lowering its resource usage.</blockquote>

  <li>Implementing Data Caching</li>
  <li>Advanced File Functionality</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module 6: Creating Reusable Controls and Components</strong></p>
<blockquote>In this module, you will learn how the Windows Runtime (WinRT) contains a rich set of XAML controls, such as GridView, ListView, FlipView, and AppBar. In many cases, you can use these controls to create fully functional apps. However, if the built-in controls do not contain the functionality that you need, you can create your own custom controls. You will be able to reuse these custom controls in other apps, like any other built-in control.<br /><br />
You can also extend the WinRT itself to expose existing or new libraries to Windows Store apps. You can create custom WinRT components, which can be used from any supported programming language (C#, VB.NET, C++, or JavaScript).</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Working with Custom and Templated Controls</li>
  <li>Creating and Using WinRT Components</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Module 7: Implementing Advanced Contract Scenarios</strong></p>
<blockquote>This module describes how to use two new contracts:
<ul>
	<li>The Play To contract enables media sharing with other devices, such as television sets.</li>
    <li>The Print contract enables interaction with printing devices.</li>
</ul>
Windows Store apps can integrate with the contacts and calendar appointments managed by the operating system. You can create new contacts and calendar appointments, update and delete existing ones.<br /><br />
Lastly, you will learn how to take advantage of several convenient Windows 8.1 application programming interface (APIs) to provide exciting, user friendly features in your apps. Windows RT has native APIs for working with Portable Document Format (PDF) files, creating screenshots of your app, and generating speech from text through speech synthesis.</blockquote>
